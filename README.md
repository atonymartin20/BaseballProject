# Baseball Project

This is a project I have wanted to build for a while.  The point of this project is to grab data from multiple baseball websites and aggregate them into one site.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
* React
* ContextAPI

### Backend
* Knex
* Node.js
* PostgresQL

# Resources
* [Front End Site - Hosted on Netlify](https://baseball-project-adm.netlify.com/)
* [Back End Site - Hosted on Heroku](https://baseball-project-adm.herokuapp.com/)
 
 # 2020 Information
 * There are currently 814 players in the database for the 2020 season.
 * 2020 Projections were pulled before COVID-19 and no longer reflect the reality of a 2020 MLB season.
 * Projections may or may not be updated once a 2020 MLB season and schedule have been announced.
 * Regardless, this will be updated for 2021 once projection systems begin to be released in late 2020 or early 2021.
